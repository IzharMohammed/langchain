    " ##### How to split by HTML header:-\n",
    " \n",
    "HTMLHeaderTextSplitter is a \\\"structure-aware\\\" chunker that splits text at the HTML element level and adds metadata for each header \\\"relevant\\\" to any given chunk. It can return chunks element by element or combine elements with the same metadata, with the objectives of (a) keeping related text grouped (more or less) semantically and (b) preserving context-rich information encoded in document structures. It can be used with other text splitters as part of a chunking pipeline"

While most manga artists use this space either to expand the chapter's length by a page or to draw a one-off illustration, Oda will take minor characters and defeated , and give them their own story arcs, which sometimes end up coinciding with the goings-on of Luffy and his crew at some point. Each of these stories, known officially as , or \"Cover Stories\" for short, run for 20 to 40 or more consecutive installments, interrupted only by title pages drawn in color. Each \"episode\" is one panel, with a caption that includes the title of the arc (given by Oda himself) and a description of what happens in the image. After each arc has run its course, there is a set of \"normal\" chapter title pages that showcases each member of the , and then a new story arc is introduced. Starting from just prior to the ninth cover arc, a new segment called \" \" began, catching up with other characters from a specific arc and their current day to day life prior to the specific story connected to the full cover arc.  \n",
